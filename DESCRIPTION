Title: A helper to make sure requirements are installed for ExpDesign2021
Description: For the practical sessions in Experimental Design & Biostats 2021,
             we rely upon a fair number of other packages. This small package 
             makes sure they're installed, and provides a script in inst/extdata
             which demonstrates how to make a package from a skeleton. That 
             script was, in fact, used to create this package. The motivation 
             for using tidy models and Rmarkdown output is summarized in 
             \url{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics-examples.html#homework-assignments-on-rpubs}. Knitted documents can be published directly from 
             Rstudio to \url{https://rpubs.com/}, so all that's left is to make
             sure that dependencies for assignments are in place. This package
             also includes a few convenience functions (phelp, lsos, etc.).
